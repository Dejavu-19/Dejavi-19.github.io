<li><strong><code>Group, easy-difficult</code></strong></li>
<li>Group by category</li>
<li>Try to come up the solution by you own</li>
<li>Figure out how long before the interview and assign the tasks wisely</li>

<h2 id="Communication"><a href="#Communication" class="headerlink" title="Communication"></a>Communication</h2><ol>
<li><strong><code>Eliminating ambiguity</code></strong> <ul>
<li>eg. at start, when you’re given the question, a lists of number, you have to do sth about it. <strong>Only integers</strong> or am I also dealing with <strong>decimal numbers</strong>. <strong>Positive/negative</strong> numbers. Can we have <strong>duplicate numbers</strong>? Can the array <strong>be sorted</strong>? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Voicing your thought progress</code></strong><ul>
<li>you don’t want your interviewers to guess things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Discussion trade-off</code></strong><ul>
<li>eg. <strong>In first solution</strong>, we transform this array into a linkedlis `t.</li>
<li><strong>In other solution</strong> we just keep the array as a typical array. </li>
<li>The linkedlist approach will be <strong>good because</strong> it would allow us to add values in linear time at any position in the linkedlist ,whereas the array would allow us to add values only in O n squared time where n is the length of the input. But on the other hand the linked list approach has a lot of overhead because we have to build the linked list at the begining. Whereas the array we’re kind of giving it for free. <strong>Overall I think I’m gonna favor</strong> the linkedlist approach because <strong>despite</strong> the overhead, it’ll simplify things the further down we are in the problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Proactively asking for approval or help form your interviewer</code></strong><ul>
<li>Can I use IMI for this variable. Is the array multible?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Warning.</code></strong> <ul>
<li>Do not over do these thing, keep a balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Problem-Solving-Ability"><a href="#Problem-Solving-Ability" class="headerlink" title="Problem Solving Ability"></a>Problem Solving Ability</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Asking clarifying questions</strong> to eliminating ambiguity</li>
<li>Take some time to <strong>discover the problem, digest the question</strong>. Do not just jump to the question rush, take some time to explore the problem and identify the hidden problem</li>
<li><strong>Discussing trade-off</strong>. Consider alternatives, consider pros and cons, trade-off, iterative or recursion method, choose which data structure, algorithm is better</li>
<li><strong>Before coding, voice your interviewer what you gonna do</strong>, <strong><code>tackle the problem in an organized manner</code></strong></li>
<li>Proactively <strong>testing the problem</strong>. In the end. Now I gonna explain how I would test my solution. Here are the edge cases that I would test for.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a <strong>brute-force solution</strong></li>
<li>Think of <strong>a simpler version of the problem</strong></li>
<li>Think with <strong>simpler examples</strong> -&gt; try noticing a pattern</li>
<li><strong>Use some visualization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test your solution on a few examples</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Coding-Skills"><a href="#Coding-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Coding Skills"></a>Coding Skills</h2><ol>
<li>Descriptive variable <strong>naming</strong></li>
<li>Abstraction, make use of <strong>helper method, separate your code</strong> into these logical units</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Descriptive code, <strong>change the condition into English</strong></li>
<li><strong>Idiomatic coding style</strong></li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Culture-Fit"><a href="#Culture-Fit" class="headerlink" title="Culture Fit"></a>Culture Fit</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Show you’re passionate about software engineering or about product development</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pick a unique aspect or product of the company and show interest in it</strong></li>
<li><strong>Introduce yourself.</strong> I am someone who’s always been interested in entrepreneurship and product management , and you know building cool things. But throughout college I had this misconception that coding was something you had to have been doing since you were a kid. So I didn’t code during college. Coming out of college I realized, hey this is something I really need. Otherwise I’m not gonna be able to achieve the things I wanna do from a career point of view. I enrolled in xxx, fell in love with software engineering. And now here I am.</li>
<li><strong>Describe your past projects and jobs well.</strong> Everything in your resume should be explain well. Try to sell yourself. What did you do at the past job/ college/ teach yourself computer science?</li>
<li><strong>逆问题What’s been your biggest challenge on the job? What’s the day in the life of you at this company?</strong></li>

<li>Reiterate the entire thinking progress talk out louder:</li>
<li>Problem statement, some constraints, edge cases</li>
<li>Approach to solve the program</li>
<li>Data structure, reason use or not use</li>
<li>eg. The program give us an array of integers and it want us to do x, we are told array is sorted and now</li>

<ol>
<li>Do not be disrespectful, offensive, mean, arrogant, confrontational.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid being too vague</strong> in your answers. <strong>Share enough information, go into enough details</strong> about your past experiences and your past stories, explain how you handle, who you work with, how you reacted to certain events, and what you learned from these events(STAR method)</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to do</p>
<ol>
<li>Strike the balance between highlighting <strong>very good qualities</strong> (you are amazing, you can write complex code, you can lead the project )and your <strong>ability work in a team</strong>, the ability to help other. Stories highlight <strong>both</strong> these two things.</li>
<li>Well you know, <strong>I don’t think I actually have this kind of experience</strong>, <strong>but I’d love to tell you how I would react or how I would behave in the circumstance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>General communication skills.</strong> Be able to convey the stories of past experiences <strong>in a concise manner</strong>. More prepare, more confidence. </li>
<li><strong>Record yourself and just rehearse some of these answers to the questions multiple times.</strong></li>

I think one of the key things that can help people who are performing not as well as they should be, is to just make yourself available to them to answer questions for them, to unblock them, and oftentimes, you have to push them to ask for help.

And this can really help them, because if it turns out that the project, or their perceived low performance wasn&#39;t their fault, it&#39;s important to have that documented</span><br><span class="line"> if they were in fact performing poorly, and they took steps to improve on their performance and actually did improve. That&#39;s a great thing to document and can actually help them a lot in their next performance review for the next promotion and so on and so forth.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Finally</span><br><span class="line">if there&#39;s a consistent issue related to performance, no improvement is perceived, nothing really changes then eventually of course,you might have to escalate to the person&#39;s manager to let them know that they might have to deal with something there. That&#39;s somebody else&#39;s job</span><br><span class="line">that&#39;s how I would handle a low performer on a team.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<li>This question will allow you to get an initial sense of your peer’s experience.</li>
<li>Feel free to ask follow-up questions, for instance, can you elaborate a bit more on your experience with [specific technology] or your responsibilities at [company]? You can also use this opportunity to ask the candidate which of their experiences had the greatest impact on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-are-you-looking-for-in-your-next-role"><a href="#What-are-you-looking-for-in-your-next-role" class="headerlink" title="What are you looking for in your next role?"></a>What are you looking for in your next role?</h2><ul>
<li>This is an opportunity to get insight into whether a candidate would be a good culture fit for your company. Is the candidate looking for a company of your size? Do their expectations match the role?</li>

Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.</h2><ul>
<li>Owner vs participant: Many candidates will claim they led a big project or created significant impact, but if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the candidate only played a participatory role or was involved in just one facet of the project. As an interviewer, it’s your role to uncover the truth. Follow-up questions asking about who was involved, what the candidate personally did, and how they did it will help you make an informed decision about the candidate’s true impact.</li>
<li>Good vs great achievements: Many candidates are good at quantifying their achievements, but you’ll want to know how big of an impact this achievement actually had. Was it a minor success or did it have a significant impact? Were the results due to the candidate’s impact, or would those results have likely occurred without their involvement? You may consider asking follow-up questions here too: try to drill down into the baseline metrics used, such as “What were the projected metrics had you not made this decision?”</li>
</ul>

<li>This question helps you evaluate how self-aware the candidate is about their personal/professional experience. Encourage the candidate to use a specific example to highlight each of their answers. For the growth portion, you should decide whether you’d like the candidate to speak about an area of growth they identified in the past and resolved or a recent growth area and their plans for overcoming it.</li>

How did you tackle it, what was the outcome, and what did you learn?</h2><ul>
<li>This question gives the candidate the opportunity to deep dive into an example of their core competencies (collaboration, communication, attention to detail, tech-savvy, etc). It allows you to get a snapshot of their self-awareness of their skills.</li>
<li>An appropriate follow-up question might be “What would you have done differently and why?”</li>

<li>This question is about teamwork and influence. You want to dig into the candidate’s ability to reason through a problem, collaborate with teammates, discuss the tradeoffs of particular actions, and ultimately, show how they were able to bring others on board with their vision.</li>
