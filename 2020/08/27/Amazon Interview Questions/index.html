When the product was released, first day sales exceeded all expectations, and sales continued on a steady incline for the rest of the year. A lot of the success was attributed to the online fan base we developed, where positive word-of-mouth spurred an influx of customers to purchase the product through the trackable online sales page we created in-house with our design and dev teams.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet my requirements. Fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end.

<ol>
<li><p>14 Leadership Principle: Study the 14 leadership principles. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Behavioral and situational interview questions: I would strongly suggest that you prepare good stories that can demonstrate your strength in those LPs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the STAR(L) format: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Learned. Spend 20% in S &amp; T, 70% in Action and 10% in R(L) of your time when you are answering. The answers should be around 2-3 minutes long.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data, data, data:</strong> Please use quantitative data when you are answering your questions. Amazons like using data and does not like using “fluff words” like “Very, extremely, greatly &amp; etc” instead use “10% YoY, 100 points increase vs the goal, 3 month ahead of initial schedule”</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare for follow up questions:</strong> we ask a lot of follow up questions to the main question. Please  prepare to answer those follow up questions. (google for follow up questions) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vSYa1XPdy0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vSYa1XPdy0</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Prepare for questions to ask for the interviewer: You will have around 10 minutes of time at the end of the interview to ask questions to the interviewer. Show your interest by asking great questions! </p>
</li>
</ol>

Cause I have no idea how to build the threat hunting structure. In order to understand it better, I googled a lot of papers and learnt a lot of basic concepts about network threat hunting. Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned the most. Cause most customers who are using our products are not professional network developer. We need to use their language to tell them the story. They just need to know if they are under specific threats, they don’t care about how we find the threats. All they need to do is just make easy decisions based on the suggestions we provide. The system will take care of all the other stuff. Like if there are brute force password attacking, the system will bubble up an alert and send an email to customer to let them know, and also providing them the links to the detailed dashboards. They can choose the suggestions provided by system, like putting the ip into the banlist.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">So, finally, after the delivery, we get positive feedbacks from customers.

<p>Tell me about a time you handled a difficult customer</p>
<h2 id="2-Ownership"><a href="#2-Ownership" class="headerlink" title="2. Ownership"></a>2. Ownership</h2><p> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.</p>
<p>STAR</p>
<p>When I joined Intel Innovation center as Intern, the Marketing Team was new, and the scope for the role wasn’t clearly defined. I knew that because the responsibilities were unclear, I should let customer objectives guide the project with feedback from me. </p>
<p>During my first customer Taichuangxing onboarding, they are a start-up company focus on education, I understood that my objective was to ensure further cooperation with their product and Intel technique and that I needed to help them realize the value of Intel product in the form of lower cost, elasticity, and speed and flexibility. In order to do that I knew that I would need to plan carefully. </p>
<p>I developed a project plan, schedule, milestones, and agreed-upon criteria with the client on what would be a successful deployment. I learned what they wanted and eventually I understood the client’s requirements better than anyone. I took responsibility for understanding and resolving the client issues, and advocated internally on behalf of the client when we needed support from other teams like when there was an escalation due to a provisioning issue. </p>
<p>Although my task was unclear in the beginning, listening to the client paid off. It was successful cooperation since we did more than the agreed-upon criteria, which instilled trust in the client to migrate more core workloads to the cloud, so the total contract value of the account increased. </p>

While it was a reasonable request, it went beyond the scope of the project I had worked out and there was no time built into the schedule for it. </p>
<p>My professor insisted on his oponion, and I also consider that it does help to my further research in long-term value. So I rework the schedule.<br>This change needs to change a part of the architecture and retaining, increased my workload about 25% in the same timeframe.<br>I did my best to complete the extra work in the time given by working later at night and also working some of the weekends.<br>Although it wasn’t an ideal situation, I managed to pull it off, and then in the final QA section, the professor was satisfied with my work.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Case 1: When I worked on the SLA project, I was required to deploy elastalert and create few rules for the alerting system. Our alerting system is based on various elasticsearch indexes, and the situations and requirements for each index are definitely different. Since I was the person who was leading SLA project, I want my customers to always have the best experience. So I started to think about automate the generation. After the agreement from my manager, I categorized the current rules and the future rules based on different scenarios and requirements. Then I wrote a bunch of shell scripts to do the automation. I also created the APIs for those alerts, so if the customer doesn’t want the rule to be enabled, he can just click on website to turn it off.

<h2 id="3-Invent-and-Simplify"><a href="#3-Invent-and-Simplify" class="headerlink" title="3. Invent and Simplify"></a>3. Invent and Simplify</h2><p>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.</p>
<p> • Tell me about a time when you invented something.</p>
<p>Case 1: When I worked at CCG, we have a ticketing system to record the development process, keep tracking all the tasks, bugs. But you know the ticketing system is a little bit crowded. It only shows a long list of tickets. With the first glance, you can hardly know current process of development. So to simplify it, I used a vis timeline to show all the tickets. Then we can see the whole process clearly through the timeline. With the timeline, we can schedule the tasks more easily. Everyone is happy with that.</p>
<h2 id="4-Are-Right-A-Lot"><a href="#4-Are-Right-A-Lot" class="headerlink" title="4. Are Right, A Lot"></a>4. Are Right, A Lot</h2><p>Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you were wrong.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.</p>
<p>Case 1: When I was building the alerting system through elastalert, I was asked to create rules for monitoring all the processes in the system. I have my initial plan to track the unique value of process names based on different sensors. But I don’t quite understand the behavior of system index, so I discussed with my manage, and he disagreed with plan. Actually we want to see the alert when the system is down, or nearly down. What we really care about is the count of processes. We want to alert when there is a significant drop in process numbers. So, after that I changed my design and everyone is happy.</p>

Usually if it’s a birthday party, we buy cake of nearly 30$, and decoration 20$, and food nearly 100$ but this time we have two constraints, one is space, because of COVID-19, I can’t invite all our friends to our home, and second is money, due to COVID-19 all students including me aren’t having on campus jobs. But still I wanted to celebrate, so, for space constraints, I told all my other friends who are living in different apartment to join in skype and sing birthday song, and play same song, and we sent them food in before, to join and eat with us. And we delt with money, as well but didn’t compromise, I purchased a cake mix and told my friends to prepared cream and we spread on it and later decorated it. And I saw YouTube video&#39;s and took help of my friends and did three dishes. And had sent to same to other friends. And finally, we surprised her with cake and decorations and we though all our friends are virtual, still had good time. And All I spent was just 50 $. this time.

<p>Case 1: My manager asked me if there’s a way to export and import kibana dashboards, visuals more easily. Cause through the GUI side, it has the number limit and it is hard to manipulate from back end. So I came up with an idea we can utilize the REST apis kibana and elasticsearch provide. We can write scripts to automate the loading process according to our own needs. I know that’s feasible. So finally I wrote the scripts and all the stuff in kibana can be exported and imported automatically in back end.</p>

<p>Case 1: Few months ago, there was an intern assigned to my project. He was helping me build the alerting system. But I found that he gets lost about what we are doing and what he is going to do. So, I told him that it is not as complex as what he is thinking about. I explained the alerting concepts to him one by one and categorized the things what we are doing and what we are going to do. After he is getting comfortable of the whole environment and what I need him to do, I started to assign him the specific task. And he is doing pretty well. So when someone comes to a new environment, getting lost is quite normal. We need to have patience to make him get comfortable of the while environment. Otherwise the efficiency will be very low. And that will also help him get used to the working environment quickly and increase his enthusiasm and devote more to the work.</p>
<h2 id="7-Insist-on-the-Highest-Standards"><a href="#7-Insist-on-the-Highest-Standards" class="headerlink" title="7. Insist on the Highest Standards"></a>7. Insist on the Highest Standards</h2><p>Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you couldn’t meet your own expectations on a project.</p>
<p>4 part modules,</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when a team member didn’t meet your expectations on a project.</p>
<p>Case 1: When I was building the alerting system, one of the important features is to generate alerting rules automatically. But I found that if the indexes are in a large scale, or we meet some edge cases, the efficiency of the process will be very low. Cause we are generating a lot of duplicate rules. So I built the cache to story the previous status, if there are new alerts happening or new indexes, then the system will create corresponding new rules for them. Otherwise it will only update them or do nothing. Also if there are old rules that we do not need anymore, we will remove them. And I also created links for those rules, so that we can save some disk space. It turned out that the efficiency was improved a lot.</p>
<h2 id="8-Think-Big"><a href="#8-Think-Big" class="headerlink" title="8. Think Big"></a>8. Think Big</h2><p>Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p>
<p>• Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.</p>
<p>My proudest professional achievement is the SLA project I owned. I tried my best to make it look perfect and make my customers have best experience. I build the machine learning tools for network threat hunting, each network anomaly and malicious event will be reported to the system. And I also created the alerting system, so that we don’t need people to sit there monitoring the boring data and create rules by hands. The alerting system will do all the stuff automatically. Customers love that, cause it really saves them a lot of time and money.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.</p>
<p>When the first version of SLA that with machine learning feature was delivered, I was starting to think about moving the machine learning platform to tensorflow. Cause one of our core features is to analyze the behavior of network. But each network has its own environment and their behaviors are definitely different, so we need to build specific judging rules and awarding rules to let it train itself. So that it can always have good performance regarding to each environment. And I’m still working on that. </p>
<h2 id="9-Bias-for-Action"><a href="#9-Bias-for-Action" class="headerlink" title="9. Bias for Action"></a>9. Bias for Action</h2><p>Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. </p>
<p>• Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?</p>
<h2 id="10-Frugality"><a href="#10-Frugality" class="headerlink" title="10. Frugality"></a>10. Frugality</h2><p>Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.</p>
<h2 id="11-Earn-Trust"><a href="#11-Earn-Trust" class="headerlink" title="11. Earn Trust"></a>11. Earn Trust</h2><p>Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.</p>
<p>• What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?</p>
<p>Emphasise that you’d want to be clear about the nature of the offence before deciding on a response.</p>
<p>Step1: identify the issue</p>
<p>Step2 : identify the cause of the issue</p>
<p>Step3:</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth.</p>
<p>How did you quickly earn your client’s trust?</p>
<h2 id="12-Dive-Deep"><a href="#12-Dive-Deep" class="headerlink" title="12. Dive Deep"></a>12. Dive Deep</h2><p>Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.</p>
<p>• Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.</p>
<p>Create elastalert rules, not only the rules, but also automate them.</p>
<p>Create a vis timeline to visual the tickets.</p>
<h2 id="13-Have-Backbone-Disagree-and-Commit"><a href="#13-Have-Backbone-Disagree-and-Commit" class="headerlink" title="13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit"></a>13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</h2><p>Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you did not accept the status quo.</p>
<p>• Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours.</p>
<p>• Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.</p>
<p>• If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?</p>
<h2 id="14-Deliver-Results"><a href="#14-Deliver-Results" class="headerlink" title="14. Deliver Results"></a>14. Deliver Results</h2><p>Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.</p>
<p>• By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.</p>
<p>• What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?</p>
<p>come to new country</p>

<p><strong>Your Response:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> “In my previous sales role, I was put in charge of the transfer to an entirely new customer relationship management (CRM) system—on top of handling my daily sales calls and responsibilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> “The goal was to have the migration to the new CRM database completed by Q3, without letting any of my own sales numbers slip below my targets.”</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> “In order to do that, I had to be very careful about how I managed all of my time. So, I blocked off an hour each day on my calendar to dedicate solely to the CRM migration. During that time, I worked on transferring the data, as well as cleaning out old contacts and updating outdated information. Doing this gave me enough time to chip away at that project, while still handling my normal tasks.”</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> “As a result, the transfer was completed two weeks ahead of deadline and I finished the quarter 10% ahead of my sales goal.”</p>

<p>But the situation is in this time we have two constraints, one is space, because of COVID-19, I can’t invite all our friends to our home, and another is money, due to COVID-19 almost all students including me aren’t having part-time jobs. But still, I wanted to celebrate, </p>
<p>What I have been done is, for space constraints, I told all my other friends who are living in a different apartment to join in zoom online and and I have sent them food in before, to join and eat with us.<br>And we dealt with money, as well but didn’t compromise, I purchased a cake and prepared strawberry and we spread on it and later decorated it . And I saw YouTube videos and took the help of my friends and did three dishes. And had sent to same to other friends. </p>
<p>And finally, we surprised him with cake and gifts and sing the birthday song with all our friends online,  and play the game online and share the screen and watch a movie together, </p>

<p>S<br>SIASUN Robot collaborative robot<br>Business-oriented -&gt; Tech<br>When I led the technical seminar for the first time, it is very challenging for me.<br>Cause I have no idea how to…<br>T<br>Invite a technical specialist from Intel or a partner company and attract as many customers in the seminar topic field and build a relationship if possible.<br>A<br>The first thing I did is search a lot of previous posts on a similar topic on the internet in order to understand it better. Including setting the schedule and word flow, a lot of basic concepts of topic about the technical seminar.<br>Second, I also ask some team members for tips on how to attract and serve the customer better, like connect with the previous partner who has a similar background to get advanced knowledge in this field. And I also learn that we should avoid involving opponent technique in our seminar and the same with the posting article. eg NVIDIA/ɪnˈvɪdiə/</p>
<p>Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned about most.<br>Cause most customers who are coming to seminars are not professional developers. We need to use their language to tell them the story.<br>They just need to know if they are easy to use and efficient, they don’t care about how to implement the algorithms.<br>All they need to do is just make easy decisions based on the suggestions we provide.

They can choose the suggestions provided by the system, like reset the robot arm.</p>
<p>R<br>So, finally, after the seminar, we invited 60 people and get positive feedback from customers.<br>We get a connection with a professor in the engineering department at Shanghai Tech University.<br>Since then I always try my best to listen to the customers and provide the best experience for them.</p>

<p>I was managing a project for one of our clients in the Intel Robotics Innovation Center which is actually a technical seminar, and I was so eager to please them that I told them we could finish the project within 2 weeks. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking 3 weeks and they were not happy.<br>Looking back, I realized I really should have been more conservative in my estimate to the client. I realized that a client isn’t going to be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to be disappointed if you promise something and then don’t deliver it. So I took this experience and used it to become much better at time managing expectations of clients during projects I oversee.<br>For example, on the next event 2018 Global AI Product Application Expo with a different client, I told them it’d take 4 weeks and we finished in 3. They were very happy about this.</p>
<p>Case 1: The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I led the Facial Multi-Attribute Detection based on CNN project for the first time. The original schedule is 4 weeks, but we suddenly received a message from ourmanager says that he will show a smartloganalyzer demo to one customer after two days. And at that time I was working on building the alerting system, that will be an important part of the demo. But I paid too much attention on details, I want to make everything perfect. I didn’t notice that I don’t have enough time to finish all the details. Last day before the demo day, my manager pointed that out. I apologized to him and then we started to figure out if there is a way to keep the demo the same as what we want it to be, but sacrificing some backend performance that customer won’t notice, cause it is just a demo. After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet my requirements. Fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end. But from this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my schedule won’t affect other’s schedule.</p>
<p>Case 2: I remember that after we first delivered the 5.1 version of SLA to customer, which is the version that first with machine learning feature and alerting feature. But the customer reported that they can not see the alerts. It is very weird cause after all the checks, all the features are running smoothly in the dev machine, but when it comes to the sensor, the alerting part will fail. After tracking the logs and error message, I found that the alerting system was not able to start at the very beginning. It seems that it doesn’t have the proper environment to run. Then I noticed that all the python related stuff in the system are based on python 3, except elastalert, which is based on python 2. So I double checked the document, I didn’t document the detail in the documentation. So the sensor doesn’t have python 2 environment. It is definitely a silly mistake. I apologized to my manager and the customer. And we added the python 2 envrionment to a new sensor as soon as possible and sent it to customer again. So, after that, I learnt that I should pay attention to each small detail during the development process, and document them in time so that we won’t forget. I need to make sure that all the things I delivered are fully qualified.</p>

So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-one meeting. During the meeting, I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked him to explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were conficting with work related to another project. We decided to move the meeting one hour later.<br>At our next meeting, he apologized in front of the group and promised this would no longer occur.

<p>I remember last time I was building the alerting system, my original schedule is one week, but my manager suddenly sent me an email said that he needs to show a demo to a customer two days later. One core feature of the demo is the alerting system. So I was asked to realize the function before two days deadline. If I still follow the original schedule, I definitely can not finish that. My original schedule is to let the alerting system generate rules automatically based on dynamic data. But I can not finish that in such a short time. So I figured out another temporary solution with my manager, is to make it a fake automation temporarily, to preset all the parameters and processes. If you run it, it will behave like generating rules automatically, so for the demo, the customer will have exactly the same experience. And I can also finish that before deadline. After that, I can make it real automation.</p>
<p>If I couldn’t finish tasks before deadline, I will discuss with my colleagues, trying to figure out a way that can improve the efficiency and If necessary, I will use my private time to keep working on the task. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. Customer experience is always the most important. We must make sure that the product we are gonna deliver is qualified. We can sacrifice our own time to try to finish the tasks. If we still can not finish the tasks, we will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.</p>

How did you tackle it, what was the outcome, and what did you learn?</h3><p>The most challenging project is my current smartloganaylzer project. It is challenging because I need to implement all the new features on my own. It requires me to build machine learning tools for network threat hunting, I haven’t done anything related to threat hunting before. And It also requires me to build RESTful APIs for the tools. I haven’t developed any RESTful API before either. It also requires me to build alerting system and But the time is not unlimited, so I started to devote more time on the project, even my private time. I googled a lot of papers related to threat hunting, like malicious url, dnstuneling, network behavior. When I came up with some ideas, I would discuss with my manager to make sure the plan is feasible. And then I learnt Go as quick as possible so that I can design and implement all the RESTful APIs on time. Finally, all the new features have been implemented on time and we received positive feedbacks from the customer. So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more you read and learn, the more problems you can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about an event that happened one year ago, while I was starting my professional<br>career, working for a company named The Game. They were quite good at developing and<br>customising 3D gaming engines, so I thought it’d be a fun place to work and to learn the tools of<br>the trade<br>After completing my first 6 months of apprenticeship. I was allowed to be part of a small team that worked on a new game, that was launched in beta and had a good ten thousand players playing it each month. It was an exciting project to work on so I spent more and more time writing code and shipping new features for the game, which got me in return a more significant role in my team of 5-and in one instance, I was even charged of the deployment of our next version of the game.</p>
<p>Instead of taking my newest set of responsibilities seriousły, I continued to spend more and more<br>time on writing code, which turned the release into an epic fail. 1 mean, the game worked normally,for the first few hours, until we left work, and due to a series of bugs, completely crashed as<br>thousands started playing the new version in the evening.<br>There was no magic solution here but to roll back to the previous version.<br>However, I would like to point out that this experience has helped me appreciate the importance of ownership in my role. I should have definitely taken my new responsibilities more seriously - that is to not hurry up things with deploying as many game features as possible for the short term, but to take my leadership role seriously and prepare the release more thoroughly, for the long term.</p>

How did you handle the situation?</h2><p>“When I was working on a project for our Agile Project Management Course, one of themember of my team would consistently show up late, or even not show up at all to ourteam meetings<br>As the leader of the team, I had to address the situation and make sure that our<br>coworker was fulfilling his responsibilities. So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-onemeeting. During the meeting I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked himto explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were<br>conficting with work related to another project. We decided to move the meeting one<br>hour later.<br>At our next meeting, he apologized in front of the group and promised this would no<br>longer occur. The project went well and in the end we got an A on our group project!</p>

After 2 months of training, he asked me to join a group of his former clients who meet once a week to give speeches in front of each other. With her help and all of their comments and support, I learned to see what my weaknesses were<br>After working on my skills for 6 months, I could see that my presentations were consistently better. My boss agreed. Now I am continuing to meet with the group so that my skills keep improving.</p>
<h2 id="Q-Regarding-the-use-of-technology-in-education-are-there-any-particular-technologies-you-feel-excited-about"><a href="#Q-Regarding-the-use-of-technology-in-education-are-there-any-particular-technologies-you-feel-excited-about" class="headerlink" title="Q: Regarding the use of technology in education, are there any particular technologies you feel excited about?"></a>Q: Regarding the use of technology in education, are there any particular technologies you feel excited about?</h2><p><strong>A:</strong> It is hard to get excited about any educational technologies during COVID-19. Mostly, we all are looking forward to getting back to campus. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it has shown us the limitations of technology-mediated learning. There is simply no substitute for educators and learners (professors and students) sharing the same physical space for much of what we do in higher education.</p>
<p>I do think that when the COVID-19 public health emergency abates, some aspects of higher education will be stronger than ever. While I am anxious about the pandemic’s impact on the financial viability of many schools, I think that we will learn a great deal from this experience. Mostly, I believe that we will see how precious a non-technologically mediated education can be. When we can come together in a physical space, we will make that time as productive and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>So the technologies that I’m excited about will be ones that make face-to-face learning better. In reality, we will see better use of existing technologies for hybrid (or blended) learning. Going forward, I expect that professors will utilize digital platforms to offload much of what had previously occurred in physical classrooms. This means less lecturing and more time for discussing, mentoring and active learning.</p>
<p>Will emerging technologies in mobile learning, adaptive learning platforms and augmented/virtual reality help in this goal? Sure. At least I hope so. But we need to keep in mind that technology is only a tool. We design our learning environments based on our goals (sometimes articulated, often not) for learning. Technology can hinder as much as it can help educators collaborate with learners to reach those goals.</p>

I think my failure is here since I liked to keep using the same examples. And I didn’t approach the question with a STAR format.</p>
<p>At the end of this journey, I can say never give up. It took me over 2 years to get this offer. I had a lot of other phone interview, but didn’t get pass those stages. So, those aren’t mentioned.</p>
<p>My advice is do not overlook behavior question. Prepare for them. At the end of doing 500 problems, before the interview, I decided it isn’t worth reviewing the problems.  I have the knowledge to work out the problem. The problem for me is can I apply it correctly. Therefore, before the on-site interview, I spend a good deal of time thinking about behavior questions and examples instead of reviewing.</p>
