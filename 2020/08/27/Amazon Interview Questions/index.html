        <h1 id="Amazon-Interview-Questions"><a href="#Amazon-Interview-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Interview Questions"></a>Amazon Interview Questions</h1><h3 id="Self-Introduction⭐⭐"><a href="#Self-Introduction⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Self Introduction⭐⭐"></a>Self Introduction⭐⭐</h3><p>Good morning, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>My name is Liu Kunling.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time today to interview me for the position of SDE intern.</p>
<p>It is really a great honor to have this opportunity for an interview here. I am currently a master’s first-year student from the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences at the University of Tokyo. I got a bachelor’s degree from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, my major is advanced energy. I have experience of working as an intern at the Intel Robotics Innovation Center in Shanghai. Besides, I have studied the courses in data science, data structures and algorithms. My research direction basically applies machine learning techniques to improve the fluid dynamic simulation method performance. </p>
<p>I hope I can make the best use of my knowledge, interpersonal communication skills, and high learning enthusiasm qualified me for this position, I wish I could have a chance to cooperate with the most efficient and professional colleagues here and do my best. </p>
<h3 id="Why-Amazon？⭐⭐"><a href="#Why-Amazon？⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Why Amazon？⭐⭐"></a>Why Amazon？⭐⭐</h3><p>Because I believe that Amazon is a type of company that tackles hard problems and really change to people’s life easier. </p>
<p>Let me share a personal story with you here you see in the beginning when I was trying to launched my first few websites, the generally accepted method was to simply buy some hosting and the database and it was essentially good to go.</p>
<p>However if one of these websites happens to work successfully that is to receive hundreds of thousands of visits per month you would know it that because it would actually crash due to high traffic so we essentially have to spend the bulk of time on these sort of technical tricks. </p>
<p>Now with Amazon AWS not only that you just use the service of ELB<code>Elastic Load Balanceing</code>, EC2<code>Elastic Compute Cloud</code> to solve this problem easily but it also has scalability by design so if your website happens to become successful you would have plenty of time to focus on what matters on things such as better customer experience or contents in the websites for instance.</p>
<p>RDS<code>Relational Database service</code>,PVC <code>Virtual Private Cloud</code></p>
<h3 id="Why-IT？"><a href="#Why-IT？" class="headerlink" title="Why IT？"></a>Why IT？</h3><p>When I worked as an intern at the Intel Robotics Innovation Center in Shanghai, I really enjoy the opportunity to experience different kinds of technology.</p>
<p>Since I was in the marketing department, I got the chance to communicate with lots of local companies in Shanghai and familiar with their product and the main technology. </p>
<p>For example, Metro inspection robot, SIASUN Robotic Arm and DJI drone.</p>
<p>This experience give me the chance to learn how technology changed people’s lives and I am really excited about it. </p>
<h3 id="Failed-mistake-⭐⭐"><a href="#Failed-mistake-⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Failed/mistake?⭐⭐"></a>Failed/mistake?⭐⭐</h3><p>I was managing a project for one of our clients in the Intel Robotics Innovation Center which is actually a technical seminar, and I was so eager to please them that I told them we could finish the project within 2 weeks. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking 3 weeks and they were not happy.<br>Looking back, I realized I really should have been more conservative in my estimate to the client. I realized that a client isn’t going to be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to be disappointed if you promise something and then don’t deliver it. So I took this experience and used it to become much better at time managing expectations of clients during projects I oversee.<br>For example, on the next event 2018 Global AI Product Application Expo with a different client, I told them it’d take 4 weeks and we finished in 3. They were very happy about this.</p>
<h3 id="Strength-short-term-value-and-long-term-value⭐⭐"><a href="#Strength-short-term-value-and-long-term-value⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Strength/short-term value and long-term value⭐⭐"></a>Strength/short-term value and long-term value⭐⭐</h3><p>I think my strength is focused more quality when compared with the quantity.</p>
<p>I took a course called CFD introduction last semester. </p>
<p>This course requires a final project in fluid mechanics simulation. </p>
<p>Basically, I can choose to finished two 2D cases or one 3D case.</p>
<p>But I think 3D is more interesting and have more benefits in long term when compared to 2D.</p>
<p>Because I think practicing a 3D simulation will be a good experience and also be of great help to my future research, the simulation data can be used as dataset in deep learning method.</p>
<p>However 3D numerical simulation is much more complicated, it is difficult to finish within the 2 weeks deadline. </p>
<p>So I communicated with the professor by email in advance and told him my thoughts and got the one-week extension.</p>
<p>Finally, I compete the 3D fluid simulation on flow passed a squared cylinder by using LES simulation method.</p>
<h3 id="Weakness⭐⭐"><a href="#Weakness⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Weakness⭐⭐"></a>Weakness⭐⭐</h3><p>I am kind of introverted person. </p>
<p>For example, if I am at a party, I may not greet strangers. I think this shortcoming will make me lose some potential opportunities to get new friends.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, I participated in the school’s one-to-one exchange program, which is a program in which introduce two people from two different countries to know each other and learning about the new language and culture, and my partner is Mr.Yoshinaga, he is big fan of animation and movie.. We have enjoy our time became close friend now. </p>
<p>In addition, I also tried to use Cambly, which is a website for people who want to learn English communicating with people all over the world.  </p>
<p>Through this website, I have talked with many people from different countries such like South Africa, the United States, and Brazil. </p>
<p>I think this not only make me become more outgoing but also broaden my horzions and learning different kinds of culture.</p>
<h3 id="Conflict⭐⭐"><a href="#Conflict⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Conflict⭐⭐"></a>Conflict⭐⭐</h3><p>When I was working on a project for our Internet Architecture Course, one of the members of my team would consistently show up late, or even not show up at all to our team meetings<br>As the leader of the team, I had to address the situation and make sure that our coworker was fulfilling his responsibilities. So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-one meeting. During the meeting, I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked him to explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were conficting with work related to another project. We decided to move the meeting one hour later.<br>At our next meeting, he apologized in front of the group and promised this would no longer occur. The project went well and in the end we got an A on our group project!</p>
<h3 id="Tell-me-about-one-time-you-take-risk-⭐⭐"><a href="#Tell-me-about-one-time-you-take-risk-⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Tell me about one time you take risk?⭐⭐"></a>Tell me about one time you take risk?⭐⭐</h3><p>I think my strength is focused more quality when compared with the quantity.</p>

<p><strong><code>Metrics</code></strong> two hundred hours for one video to two hundred dollars for one video and maintaining a regular upload schedule they would only receive between </p>
<p><strong><code>Metrics</code></strong>50 and 100 views and this happened for a period of around </p>
<p><strong><code>Metrics</code></strong>three months of trial and error where no one would watch my content or subscribe to my YouTube content or subscribe to my YouTube channel so I had to cancel the series </p>

They were quite good at developing and<br>customising 3D gaming engines, so I thought it’d be a fun place to work and to learn the tools of<br>the trade<br>After completing my first 6 months of apprenticeship. I was allowed to be part of a small team that worked on a new game, that was launched in beta and had a good ten thousand players playing it each month. It was an exciting project to work on so I spent more and more time writing code and shipping new features for the game, which got me in return a more significant role in my team of 5-and in one instance, I was even charged of the deployment of our next version of the game.</p>
<p>Instead of taking my newest set of responsibilities seriousły, I continued to spend more and more<br>time on writing code, which turned the release into an epic fail. 1 mean, the game worked normally,for the first few hours, until we left work, and due to a series of bugs, completely crashed as<br>thousands started playing the new version in the evening.<br>There was no magic solution here but to roll back to the previous version.<br>However, I would like to point out that this experience has helped me appreciate the importance of ownership in my role. I should have definitely taken my new responsibilities more seriously - that is to not hurry up things with deploying as many game features as possible for the short term, but to take my leadership role seriously and prepare the release more thoroughly, for the long term.</p>

I realized needed to be resolvecand began a push to revamp the app along with the IT department. It took us6 months, but in the end we rolled out the new online app and it was well<br>received. This and effort from other departments helped the organization<br>notch customer engagement of 85% from just 65% earlier over the next 2<br>years. We improved the region’s profitability by 15%.”</p>

I tried to listen to each of them and<br>respond calmly. 1 explained to them that we understood the problem, whichwas definitely our omission, and apologized. In the end, they agreed to giveus one more chance; fast forward today and around 95% of them are still part<br>of our customer base.”</p>

So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-onemeeting. During the meeting I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked himto explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were<br>conficting with work related to another project.

Your Big Data division is also any analysts dream job and yes I’m the type of person who gets excited by working with petabytes of data and full stack technologies also that <strong><code>ownership</code></strong> is something that rhythms with my own set of values and I’m also confident of keeping even your most difficult <strong><code>customers</code></strong> happy.</p>
<p>mention principles</p>
<h3 id="solution2"><a href="#solution2" class="headerlink" title="solution2"></a>solution2</h3><p>better</p>
<p>Because I believe that Amazon is a type of company that tackles hard problems and really change to people’s life.<br>Let me share a personal story with you here you see in the beginning when I launched my first few websites, the generally accepted method was to simply buy some hosting and the database and it was essentially good to go.<br>However if one of your websites happens to work that is to receive hundreds of thousands of visits per month you would know it that because it would actually crash due to high traffic so we essentially have to spend the bulk of your time on caching mechanisms and all sort of technical tricks. Now with Amazon AWS not only that you just use ELB, EC2, RDS to solve this problem easily but it also has scalability by design so if your website happens to become successful you would have plenty of time to focus on what matters on things such as better customer experience or content in your websites for instance.</p>
<p><strong>“Why Amazon” - Example answer</strong></p>
<p>I want to work at Amazon for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, I admire how customer-obsessed Amazon is. This is something I’ve experienced first-hand when dealing with the customer support of the company. And it’s also a principle I’ve been pushing at my current company.</p>
<p>Second, one of my co-workers used to be a Senior Product Manager at Amazon in Seattle. He has really great things to say about the company and often talks about how much he learned about product management there. I look forward to being immersed in that environment.</p>
<p>Third, I’ve spent the last five years of my career in the streaming space and really like that industry. I love the Amazon Video product and how it is positioned in the market. I’m therefore really excited to be joining that specific team.</p>
