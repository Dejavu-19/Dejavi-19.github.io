<p>做了一道flatten binary tree to double linked list。<br>用stack辅助中序遍历做的，面试官说这不是in place的，不让用stack。面试官引导下，给改成了循环中只保存上一个节点。。<br>当时没有跟他argue。感觉面试官对in place理解有问题，只保存前一节点，实现不了中序遍历吧。</p>
<p>这个题不用morris traverse（morris traverse说实话太难记准确了，面试中如果遇到非要要求写这个的就是gg<br>这个题用morris的某一个思想就行了：对某一个node，找到左子树的rightmost，然后把node.right连到rightmost的右边，node的right指向node.left, 并且把node.left置空。然后主循环就是:while node 然后node不断右指就好了。(楼上某老哥已经贴出来代码了</p>

In this competition, we use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data covers stores in three US States and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. With these datasets, we need to improve forecasting accuracy as much as we can.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I am the initial organizer of our team and other group members don&#39;t know each other before we work together. In this work, my role is mainly data cleaning and part of feature engineering based on some packages like NumPy or pandas to preprocessing the data like selling price, calendar. Change the data type of price to int, the CSV file row and column conversion, etc. After that summarize features like lag, rolling and time feature. </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In my opinion, the tricky part is in feature engineering.</span><br><span class="line">For example, we need to converting the feature based on the lunar calendar and lunar phase cycle since it&#39;s relevant to the festivals. Other features like lag characteristics, which are the sales of goods in the first seven days, the first 14 days, 21 days, 28 days, 35 days. The rolling feature, which represents the time period, 1-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days. Time feature, which the day of the week(Like Monday, Tuesday, etc ), which day of the month, which day of the year, month, quarter, year and so on. At the same time, price characteristics the product are also need to be talked into consideration, like maximum, minimum, average, median, etc. A good result based on a well understanding of the specific problem and a well understanding equals feature engineering.</span><br><span class="line">As result, after the delivery, I got a silver medal with the rank of 43&#x2F;5558. In this project, I learned about the importance of teamwork and communication. During that time, we have clearly divided the tasks and conducted group discussions every week. Based on everyone&#39;s different knowledge backgrounds, many problems can be resolved after the discussion. And anyone can not finish the whole project. In terms of technology, I also learned the skills of model fusion from my partner, which is simultaneous use of different models such as xgb, lgb, and weighted mixed models to get a better result.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I am very interested in machine learning technology. I believe this field will continue to flourish in the future, which is also a necessary knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. My laboratory is focused on the study of fluid mechanics, and my research is to apply deep learning technology to improve the results of CFD numerical simulation. Specifically, high-resolution technology(GAN) in computer vision is used to improve the numerical simulation results. In addition to learning artificial intelligence-related courses in school, in my spare time, I learn the deep learning series of courses taught by Stanford Professor Andrew Ng on Coursera and obtained certification. In addition, I also have a strong interest in the front-end of software engineering. I taught myself java, and the data structure and algorithm of Berkeley University. Therefore, I think the position I applied for is suitable for me. Although I am still in the learning stage, I think that with a certain amount of practical experience accumulation, I will be able to hold the position and challenge the various problems encountered in real life.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>S<br>SIASUN Robot collaborative robot<br>Business-oriented -&gt; Tech<br>When I led the technical seminar for the first time, it is very challenging for me.<br>Cause I have no idea how to…<br>T<br>Invite a technical specialist from Intel or a partner company and attract as many customers in the seminar topic field and build a relationship if possible.<br>A<br>The first thing I did is search a lot of previous posts on a similar topic on the internet in order to understand it better. Including setting the schedule and word flow, a lot of basic concepts of topic about the technical seminar.<br>Second, I also ask some team members for tips on how to attract and serve the customer better, like connect with the previous partner who has a similar background to get advanced knowledge in this field. And I also learn that we should avoid involving opponent technique in our seminar and the same with the posting article. eg NVIDIA/ɪnˈvɪdiə/</p>
<p>Based on that, I started to work with customers to figure out what kind of problems that customers concerned about most.<br>Cause most customers who are coming to seminars are not professional developers. We need to use their language to tell them the story.<br>They just need to know if they are easy to use and efficient, they don’t care about how to implement the algorithms.<br>All they need to do is just make easy decisions based on the suggestions we provide. The system will take care of all the other stuff.  Like if there is a security system, the system will bubble up an alert to let them know, and also providing them the detailed dashboards. They can choose the suggestions provided by the system, like reset the robot arm.</p>
<p>R<br>So, finally, after the seminar, we invited 60 people and get positive feedback from customers.<br>We get a connection with a professor in the engineering department at Shanghai Tech University.<br>Since then I always try my best to listen to the customers and provide the best experience for them.</p>

<p>I was managing a project for one of our clients in the Intel Robotics Innovation Center which is actually a technical seminar, and I was so eager to please them that I told them we could finish the project within 2 weeks. I thought this was doable, but it ended up taking 3 weeks and they were not happy.<br>Looking back, I realized I really should have been more conservative in my estimate to the client. I realized that a client isn’t going to be upset if you’re clear about the timeline in advance, but they are going to be disappointed if you promise something and then don’t deliver it. So I took this experience and used it to become much better at time managing expectations of clients during projects I oversee.<br>For example, on the next event 2018 Global AI Product Application Expo with a different client, I told them it’d take 4 weeks and we finished in 3. They were very happy about this.</p>
<p>Case 1: The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I led the Facial Multi-Attribute Detection based on CNN project for the first time. The original schedule is 4 weeks, but we suddenly received a message from ourmanager says that he will show a smartloganalyzer demo to one customer after two days. And at that time I was working on building the alerting system, that will be an important part of the demo. But I paid too much attention on details, I want to make everything perfect. I didn’t notice that I don’t have enough time to finish all the details. Last day before the demo day, my manager pointed that out. I apologized to him and then we started to figure out if there is a way to keep the demo the same as what we want it to be, but sacrificing some backend performance that customer won’t notice, cause it is just a demo. After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet my requirements. Fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end. But from this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my schedule won’t affect other’s schedule.</p>
<p>Case 2: I remember that after we first delivered the 5.1 version of SLA to customer, which is the version that first with machine learning feature and alerting feature. But the customer reported that they can not see the alerts. It is very weird cause after all the checks, all the features are running smoothly in the dev machine, but when it comes to the sensor, the alerting part will fail. After tracking the logs and error message, I found that the alerting system was not able to start at the very beginning. It seems that it doesn’t have the proper environment to run. Then I noticed that all the python related stuff in the system are based on python 3, except elastalert, which is based on python 2. So I double checked the document, I didn’t document the detail in the documentation. So the sensor doesn’t have python 2 environment. It is definitely a silly mistake. I apologized to my manager and the customer. And we added the python 2 envrionment to a new sensor as soon as possible and sent it to customer again. So, after that, I learnt that I should pay attention to each small detail during the development process, and document them in time so that we won’t forget. I need to make sure that all the things I delivered are fully qualified.</p>

<h2 id="Conflict⭐⭐"><a href="#Conflict⭐⭐" class="headerlink" title="Conflict⭐⭐"></a>Conflict⭐⭐</h2><p>When I was working on a project for our Internet Architecture Course, one of the members of my team would consistently show up late, or even not show up at all to our team meetings<br>As the leader of the team, I had to address the situation and make sure that our coworker was fulfilling his responsibilities. So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-one meeting. During the meeting, I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked him to explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were conficting with work related to another project. We decided to move the meeting one hour later.<br>At our next meeting, he apologized in front of the group and promised this would no longer occur. The project went well and in the end we got an A on our group project!</p>

<p>有没有ddl快到了，做了comprimise的例子，deadline 过后有没有做什么 improvement，怎么做。这个我就说了一个课程项目，ddl快到了，只把base的情况做了，没有做完bonus part</p>
<p>I remember last time I was building the alerting system, my original schedule is one week, but my manager suddenly sent me an email said that he needs to show a demo to a customer two days later. One core feature of the demo is the alerting system. So I was asked to realize the function before two days deadline. If I still follow the original schedule, I definitely can not finish that. My original schedule is to let the alerting system generate rules automatically based on dynamic data. But I can not finish that in such a short time. So I figured out another temporary solution with my manager, is to make it a fake automation temporarily, to preset all the parameters and processes. If you run it, it will behave like generating rules automatically, so for the demo, the customer will have exactly the same experience. And I can also finish that before deadline. After that, I can make it real automation.</p>
<p>If I couldn’t finish tasks before deadline, I will discuss with my colleagues, trying to figure out a way that can improve the efficiency and If necessary, I will use my private time to keep working on the task. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. Customer experience is always the most important. We must make sure that the product we are gonna deliver is qualified. We can sacrifice our own time to try to finish the tasks. If we still can not finish the tasks, we will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.</p>

How did you tackle it, what was the outcome, and what did you learn?</h3><p>The most challenging project is my current smartloganaylzer project. It is challenging because I need to implement all the new features on my own. It requires me to build machine learning tools for network threat hunting, I haven’t done anything related to threat hunting before. And It also requires me to build RESTful APIs for the tools. I haven’t developed any RESTful API before either. It also requires me to build alerting system and But the time is not unlimited, so I started to devote more time on the project, even my private time. I googled a lot of papers related to threat hunting, like malicious url, dnstuneling, network behavior. When I came up with some ideas, I would discuss with my manager to make sure the plan is feasible. And then I learnt Go as quick as possible so that I can design and implement all the RESTful APIs on time. Finally, all the new features have been implemented on time and we received positive feedbacks from the customer. So through this process, I learnt that it is so important to be curious and keep learning, the more you read and learn, the more problems you can solve. The feeling of ownership is really really important, the product is just like your own child. So “I don’t know how to do it” will never be the excuse.</p>

I was allowed to be part of a small team that worked on a new game, that was launched in beta and had a good ten thousand players playing it each month. It was an exciting project to work on so I spent more and more time writing code and shipping new features for the game, which got me in return a more significant role in my team of 5-and in one instance, I was even charged of the deployment of our next version of the game.</p>
<p>Instead of taking my newest set of responsibilities seriousły, I continued to spend more and more<br>time on writing code, which turned the release into an epic fail. 1 mean, the game worked normally,for the first few hours, until we left work, and due to a series of bugs, completely crashed as<br>thousands started playing the new version in the evening.<br>There was no magic solution here but to roll back to the previous version.<br>However, I would like to point out that this experience has helped me appreciate the importance of ownership in my role. I should have definitely taken my new responsibilities more seriously - that is to not hurry up things with deploying as many game features as possible for the short term, but to take my leadership role seriously and prepare the release more thoroughly, for the long term.</p>
<p>Key word </p>
<p>customer centricity</p>
<p>dive deep of ownership</p>

How did you handle the situation?"></a>Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a team member. How did you handle the situation?</h2><p>“When I was working on a project for our Agile Project Management Course, one of themember of my team would consistently show up late, or even not show up at all to ourteam meetings<br>As the leader of the team, I had to address the situation and make sure that our<br>coworker was fulfilling his responsibilities. So I contacted X and scheduled a one-on-onemeeting. During the meeting I provided examples of meetings that he was late or evenfailed to attend and explain why this was an issue for the entire team. Also, I asked himto explain why this was happening? He explained that many of these meetings were<br>conficting with work related to another project. We decided to move the meeting one<br>hour later.<br>At our next meeting, he apologized in front of the group and promised this would no<br>longer occur. The project went well and in the end we got an A on our group project!</p>

After 2 months of training, he asked me to join a group of his former clients who meet once a week to give speeches in front of each other. With her help and all of their comments and support, I learned to see what my weaknesses were<br>After working on my skills for 6 months, I could see that my presentations were consistently better. My boss agreed. Now I am continuing to meet with the group so that my skills keep improving.</p>
<h2 id="Q-Regarding-the-use-of-technology-in-education-are-there-any-particular-technologies-you-feel-excited-about"><a href="#Q-Regarding-the-use-of-technology-in-education-are-there-any-particular-technologies-you-feel-excited-about" class="headerlink" title="Q: Regarding the use of technology in education, are there any particular technologies you feel excited about?"></a>Q: Regarding the use of technology in education, are there any particular technologies you feel excited about?</h2><p><strong>A:</strong> It is hard to get excited about any educational technologies during COVID-19. Mostly, we all are looking forward to getting back to campus. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it has shown us the limitations of technology-mediated learning. There is simply no substitute for educators and learners (professors and students) sharing the same physical space for much of what we do in higher education.</p>
<p>I do think that when the COVID-19 public health emergency abates, some aspects of higher education will be stronger than ever. While I am anxious about the pandemic’s impact on the financial viability of many schools, I think that we will learn a great deal from this experience. Mostly, I believe that we will see how precious a non-technologically mediated education can be. When we can come together in a physical space, we will make that time as productive and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>So the technologies that I’m excited about will be ones that make face-to-face learning better. In reality, we will see better use of existing technologies for hybrid (or blended) learning. Going forward, I expect that professors will utilize digital platforms to offload much of what had previously occurred in physical classrooms. This means less lecturing and more time for discussing, mentoring and active learning.</p>
<p>Will emerging technologies in mobile learning, adaptive learning platforms and augmented/virtual reality help in this goal? Sure. At least I hope so. But we need to keep in mind that technology is only a tool. We design our learning environments based on our goals (sometimes articulated, often not) for learning. Technology can hinder as much as it can help educators collaborate with learners to reach those goals.</p>
